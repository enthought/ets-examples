"""
Forest Fire Simulation
======================

This example runs cellular automata simulation and saves the results as a
GIF image.

In this example, we use a modified version of a forest fire
simulation with the following states:

- Empty cell: 0
- Healthy tree: 1
- Burning tree: 2

Every tick:

- an empty cell can grow a tree
- lightning randomly starts fires in trees
- fire spreads to neighbouring trees and trees which were previously
  on fire die

This model was originally introduced in:

    Drossel, B. and Schwabl, F. (1992),
    "Self-organized critical forest-fire model."
    Phys. Rev. Lett. 69, 1629â€“1632.
