ETS Examples
============

Examples showing how the Enthought Tool Suite packages can work together.
The following examples are available, in rough order from simplest to most
complex.

To-Do List Application
----------------------

A very simple Traits and TraitsUI application that provides a to-do list and
a GUI that goes with it.  This example demonstrates:

* a Traits model for "business logic".
* using TraitsUI with a Model-View-ViewModel architecture.
* TraitsUI handlers.
* simple TraitsUI Action usage.

Cellular Automation Library
---------------------------

A Traits library that provides tools to explore and run various cellular
automaton simulations (such as  Conway's "game of life").  This example
demonstrates

* a moderately complex Traits model for "business logic".
* using abstract base classes with Traits to specify interfaces.
* using composition rather than inheritance to produce behaviours.
* using Traits notification system to observe model state independent
  without the model needing to specifically support observation.
